And Then Fell The Rain
The clouds scudded by,
In the placid sky,
Turning it darker and darker.
Winds gathered fast,
Harmony doesn't last,
The lights went out of the sky.
Descended the gloom,
Flowers refused to bloom,
Nothing was cheerful anymore.
A droplet did swell,
To the earth it fell,
And then fell the rain.

There is a void in the world now,
Inky loss seeping into the wood,
The frame absorbs the regrets,
The door of hope collapses.
The is a hole in the fabric now,
Moths of despair did feast,
They still chew through the cloth,
Falls away the fabric of esteem.
There is a crack in the glass now,
Pain diffuses through it,
It bends the crystal contours,
Shatters the idol of self.
There is a space somewhere now,
Hollowed away by sacrifice,
Waiting to be filled again,
To negate the emptiness.

I wear a mask,
A socially acceptable,
Ceramic lid.
Its made up of,
Colours light.
The darkness is,
Concealed well.
It wants to ooze out,
Like sticky ink.
Why is it darkness?
It is a part of me,
After all?
Or does it,
Completely make,
My personality?
How much of the mask,
Is true and how much
False?
Does the light,
Even exist?
Let us call it,
The darkness,
Because that's what,
Society does.
Soon there will be cracks.
The darkness will flow.
And after that,
The mask will turn,
Into shards.

I hear the blend of music,
Of voices sweet and mild,
I let the sounds enter,
Fascinate my inner child.
The sounds amplify,
The silences inside,
The lack of company,
Saddens my mind.
All around me are,
Shared admirations,
While I sit savouring,
My lonely sensations.
Music washes over me,
Tinged with gloom,
A sombre memory,
Friendships didn't bloom.
Music is supposed to,
Be enjoyed to the end,
It would have been so,
With the presence of a friend.

There was a time I loved you,
In ways I couldn't imagine,
You used to set my soul free.
We moulded and shaped each other,
Made us into what we were,
Till the day we parted.
Since then I have changed,
I have lost myself in the sea,
I left my heart behind at home,
Or the place I thought you would be,
I left myself in a coffin,
But managed to carry my body with me.
I let lose my sadness in torrents of rain,
Only to have it fall down upon me again.
I thought we were like a forest and a spark,
Exquisite but destructive.
Yet you wouldn't think so yourself.
You left us behind in the dust.
Let your life be a roller coaster.
You are happier without me.
Here I am now.
Running
Tripping
Crawling
Trying not to stop,
Trying to move on.
I wanted to be your best.
I wanted to make you happy.
I wanted us to last longer than we did.
We got so less time together.
The distance ruined us.
So did your immaturity,
My jealousy.
You never called me beautiful.
You passed over me for girls
Who I can't hold a candle to.
You made me sad and happy in equal measures.
Now we are free of each other.
So why do I want your chains back?
Why do I want to be your prisoner again?
Did I love you so much that I lost myself?
Is it only our memories?
We both don't regret anything we did.
We gave each other so much.
Now we are strangers again.
If we ever meet in life,
I want you to know,
I loved you more than I can ever express.

I saw a bird on the tree,
Looking up at the sky,
It fluttered and twittered,
Spread its wings to fly.
I wanted to hold the bird,
To possess it in flight,
I tried and it resisted,
With all its might.
As it slipped from me,
Leaving an empty fist,
It went out of my reach,
Obscured in the mist.

I will fade away,
To the corners of your mind,
Become fictional,
In the framework of your life,
A lost scent in the cool breeze.

A broken heart is
A terminal woe.
It strikes you fast,
And does not go.
Your days are same,
The nights are long,
In your mind stays,
A very sad song.
Your eyes see sights,
Of good old memories,
Why can't they be forgotten?
It is a big mystery.
You feel as if
You have never felt good,
You always tend to stay,
In a depressed mood.
What does not kill you,
Makes you stronger,
Even if the hole in your heart,
Turns out to be larger.
A broken heart,
The terminal woe,
Will hit you hard,
And never let go.

From behind the clouds emerged the moon,
In a willow a nightingale began to croon,
In the sky, like diamonds, they came too soon,
The stars, their light on the earth like a boon.
The moon with its sharp pearly glow,
And the wind which merrily began to flow,
All came together to show,
That far from nature you cannot go.
If you close your eyes and feel,
The vitality of the world and its zeal,
It stamps upon you like a seal,
The cycle of changes like a wheel.

A chance was given
A deal was struck,
There was no scope,
For the miracle of luck.
There was toil,
And there was pain,
While running towards,
The hill of gain.
The past we cannot,
Even fathom to change,
Mysteries of time,
Are not in our range.
To throw away,
The only chance you get,
Will lead to blooming,
Of the flowers of regret.

She lies down on her bed. The door is locked. The windows are shut. Isolated from the world by her thoughts, she prefers darkness to light, for light will be a mockery of her situation. She can feel herself in every fibre of her body; her heartbeat in every cell, her breath rushing through every bone. Even as she contemplates endless oblivion, she has never felt more alive. Her hands are trembling.
She thinks of herself as a coward. Only a coward would do what she absurdly desires; to feel the life being sucked out of her, to contemplate on the unfairness of life, to hope for rebirth and then shun those thoughts. Why would she be granted another life when she so badly wants to destroy what she has? She cannot take it anymore; neither the tedium and disappointment of life nor her inability to change it. She knows her indecisiveness is to be blamed. She could never make her own decisions in life. Even now she does not know how to complete this dastardly deed. She condemns herself for it but it is all she wants. Death is her only salvation. She cannot take it anymore.
She walks out of the room, into the hallway, opens the balcony, and looks out of it. She wonders if heaven has leafy green trees like the ones in her vista. If the moon shines in just a sliver like it does now. Heaven has always been pictured as white and drab. Even the gates are pearly; well, what is life without colour? Oddly, she feels blessed; blessed to be alive to feel, to want, to love and to act. Then she remembers her cancer; fourth stage and very terminal; eating her from inside and corroding her body, the back attack of chemotherapy destroying her appetite and willpower in a single stroke, the constant shedding of hair. Stripped of human dignity she wants to end life on her own terms. She still has her regrets; regrets of not going to the doctor when she started falling ill repeatedly, regrets of not living life when she could, worrying all the time. To be fair, she could not anticipate the storm coming to ravage her life. Who can?
She has relapsed for the third time now. She knows the end is near. She wants it to end on her own terms. Then, the sun rises; a brilliant facade of reds and orange rains down on the trees before her. The moon seems to have gone to someplace without suffering. She could have too. For now she is content to watch the sun. It is a brand new day that she wants to experience. Her suicide attempt may have failed, but don't you think she succeeded?

The things we do for each other,
Narrate a merry tale,
Of friendship and reliance,
Still fresh, not yet stale.
The absurdity of the tasks,
Makes me roll my eyes,
They seem so bizzare,
But are truth, not lies.
We question not the other one,
When these requests are made,
We take it in our stride,
Our resolves never do fade.
We never really do wonder,
When we are asked for advice,
We give it our best shot,
Unpolluted by our avarice.
I think we have our own definition, 
Of what constitutes a friend,
I hope this tangled bond of ours,
Lasts till the very end

It seems like a long time back,
But it has only been a few days,
Since my heart is under attack,
From your charming and sweet ways.
Your smile drives me crazy,
Your body makes me yearn,
Even though I am lazy,
You make me want to learn.
I want to learn more about you,
About your life and your mind,
You make this world seem new,
With your conscience so kind.
You are something big for me,
A ray of hope in this endless void,
I hope that I can make you see,
Till now of what I was devoid.
I did not know what it was,
To be loved and cherished,
My empty past aches with loss,
It is dull like silver tarnished.
Now I have a glowing present,
And a happy chance for a life,
Your heart to me you have lent,
What if one day I am your wife?

Do I Feel It Too?
You stand close to me,
As close as we can get,
As far as we can be,
The illusion of passion is set.
You put your hand in mine,
Encircle you arm on my waist,
Like the effect of heady wine,
We sway without any haste.
Our feet glide across the floor,
You spin me when you can,
When you stop I want it more,
This primal desire of man.
You dip me and we lock eyes,
And stay there for a while,
Then you spout so many lies,
Punctuated with a smile.
Do you feel it too?
Or is it all in my head,
The attraction that we brew,
Is it all very dead?
Was it all a dream,
When we slow danced?
Hear my silent scream,
As my heart is lanced.
Your body is no different,
You still smell the same,
Now I wonder what you meant,
And was it all a game.
I wish you could feel,
Whatever it is I do,
Break your solid seal,
Let us start anew.

I know a Mister Funny Guy,
Whose jokes worsen as time goes by,
But he can never stop,
So when they are a flop,
Oh we all wish for him to die.
Let Me
Let me drown in your eyes,
And like a dolphin rise,
Through the depths of your soul.
Let me float in your arms,
Buoyed up by your charms,
Above the shore of your mind.
Let me sink into your heart,
So that I can be a part,
Of the glorious being that is you.

I want to do to you,
What the air does to the rain,
Lets it flow through gently,
Without restraint or pain.
I want to do to you,
What the rain does to the earth,
Moistens and enlivens,
Awakens it in mirth.
I want to do to you,
What the earth does to man,
Becomes the plane of existence,
Where he slept, he say, he ran.
I want to do to you,
What man does to the air,
Holds for an instant and lets go,
This lifetime of seconds to bear.

Tell me, oh my dear friend,
How will you feel at the end,
Of this time in our life,
When we live without strife?
I know for sure I will be sad,
For all our talks sane and mad,
Have no substitute on this earth,
Of fuzzy warmth there will be a dearth,
Gone will be the hidden intimacies,
Gone will be the profound ecstacies,
Whose hand will I hold in bed?
Who will wake me from the dead?
With whom will I eat in one plate?
With whom will I enter PBose late?
All these days with you seem a blur,
Wrapped as though in my blanket of fur,
I wish I could relive all these days,
When you and I have merged our ways.

I rarely see you these days,
We have gone our different ways,
But on the days that we do meet,
I long for you to take a seat,
For you look tired and run-down,
Your lips sometimes grace a frown,
There are dark circles under your eyes,
Your claims of well-being are pure lies,
You seem as though bereft of sleep,
All this is lieu of the promises you keep,
So now when my gaze lands on you,
There bubbles a tenderness new,
A feeling yearning to soothe,
To turn to childhood your youth,
A tender embrace in my arms,
A warmth to ease all your qualms,
One day will hold you tight,
Till I am sure you are all right.

I made a mistake,
I crossed a line,
Now you are silent,
And nothing's fine.
Believe me when I say,
It was not my intention,
To inconvinience or hurt,
Or to give you tension.
Sometimes you are,
The only one who,
I can go to for help,
But I had no clue.
You were too busy,
To heed to my cries,
That others heard,
And made up lies.
Lies that troubled you,
Lies that tore us apart,
Now I sit waiting,
With a heavy heart.
I long to hear from you,
I still want to be a friend,
This is not at all how,
I want things to end.
I made a mistake,
But a honest one,
Driven to by despair,
Not in jest or fun.
I crossed a line,
The one decided,
I did not think,
I jumped instead.
I hate upsetting you,
Your silence perturbs,
I want to call you,
But my logic curbs.
I sincerely hope that,
If I give you your space,
I will have another chance,
To see your adorable face.
But if this is how,
Things are to end,
I will forever cherish you,
As my greatest friend.

A constant haze fills up the room,
It obscured the agent of doom,
Who enters into the room late,
While my weary heart does wait,
To have his aura invade the space,
And my mangled thoughts do race,
To possibilities all unclear,
The anhillation of all dear,
To me, as all of it is,
The soft target it does not miss,
He reaches deep into my soul,
And swallows my desire whole,
And leaves my body a mere husk,
That longs for him and smells of musk,
A broken heart and a blurred mind,
Seeks something it cannot find,
Restless and so unsure,
This madness has no cure

Shaky, shallow breaths populate my lungs,
My heart keeps rythm like a snare drum,
On a glass tower my hopes are hung,
This heady feeling worse than the work of rum.
My eyes are the biggest traitors I know,
They go and land where they aren'rt suppossed to,
What new wonders will the same creature show,
There is only so much anyone can do.
There are so many sensations that I feel,
None too rational or useful in life,
My peace did they all sucessfully steal,
My heart and mind thrown in strife.
This breaks the dielectric barrier of air,
Electricity crackles between us,
He remains oblivious under my stare,
Everything turned toxic inside lust.
His presence itself unnerves me,
He is dangerous in this proximity,
All I long is to be completely free,
Of this feeling in its totality.

They Say
Build bridges not walls,
They say, 
As they sit in their concrete cubes,
Divisions are outside the walls,
They say,
As they build glass ones inside.
Do they really exist if unseen?
They think,
As a free spirit runs into it.
Shocked into bleeding lips,
She thinks,
How are there walls here?
Enough of this abstract analogy,
I say,
I only wish to tell you my story.
It is not only my story,
It happens to anyone
Who doesnt fit into
36-24-36,
Or whatever sexy is,
Since I last checked.
How easy it is to label,
Others around as sexist, 
When your eyes wander,
While searching for talent.
Dance is a sync of motion,
Dance is an outlet of emotion,
When did it ever become,
A festival of sizes?
You say, 
Where does my talent lie?
In my curvy, sorry small chest?
In my flat, sorry fat stomach?
In my perfect, sorry flawed figure?
Or does it lie elsewhere?
For instance, in the sharpness
Of my hands as they wack,
Or in the strength of my feet,
As they krump and stomp,
Or in the sparkle of my eyes,
As they sing the lyrics?
So why is it like this,
That when I match the beat,
And toe all the lines,
They put me behind
People who I outshine, 
Just because of their,
Slenderness and curves
All in the right places?
Even when I have garnered,
A lot more experience than them?
Where is their outrage,
When they use sexist guidelines?
While they balk at the 
Comments and insults hurled at them,
They fail to see their own folly.
They say that we are all equal,
But their actions betray their thoughts.
Everytime I am pushed behind someone 'sexy',
Sexism wins.
Build bridges not walls,
They say,
As they sit in their concrete cubes,
Introspect and shatter glass,
I say, 
To those blissfully unaware.

To The Boy Who Could Never Be Mine:
Oh dear friend of mine,
Like a diamond you shine,
In shelteted corners you hide,
In my broken heart you reside.
Oh, my elusive love,
Peaceful like a dove,
As quiet as a breath,
Remembered till death.
Oh, my clearly lost man,
I will find you if I can,
Though you were never mine,
I know and somehow its fine.
Oh, my lovely soul,
You always make me whole,
In some faraway weather,
We are surely together.

I am leaving this place,
The one where I sought refuge,
From my tormented thoughts.
But I am also leaving myself here,
Between these tall peaks,
As a reminder of what I was.
I left my soul in the lake,
My sanity dissolved in the caves,
The last of my strength left me,
On the winding road to the top.
I climbed up to a high peak,
Just to sit and ruminate there,
And I sloughed off my broken heart,
To cast it in the wind.
I leave my essence here,
In the skidding footsteps on trails,
On the rocks that welcomed me,
When I shunned them ungratefully.
I leave with nothing to my name,
But a sense of peace
And a well of darkness,
As I prepare to remake myself.

I am just a broken-hearted butterfly,
Trying to find patches of sunlight,
Through the crevices of rocks,
Of the caves I am imprisoned in.

Flashes of light behind sheets of cloud
And eerie scene devoid of thunder loud
A stagnant atmosphere in the anticipation of rain
Punctuated by strong winds howling in pain
From left to right do these trees sway
In a too constrained and controlled way
Unblinking lights pierce a would be dark
The sky is light and not in a contrast stark
Everything is in motion and everything is still
Nature's assult blooms under its capricious will.
